ZPortfolio - A Modern Developer Portfolio
<div align="center">

</div>

A highly interactive, performance-optimized personal portfolio built with Next.js, Framer Motion, and a cyberpunk-inspired aesthetic.

This repository contains the source code for my personal developer portfolio, designed to showcase my skills in modern web development, data science, and UI/UX design. The project was born from the need to create a stable, fast, and visually stunning platform that not only lists my work but also serves as a testament to my technical capabilities.

‚ú® Key Features
This portfolio is more than just a list of projects; it's an interactive experience.

Fully Responsive Layout: A seamless experience on all devices, featuring an adaptive "mini icon-only" sidebar for tablets and mobiles that expands on desktop.

Interactive UI & Animations: Fluid and engaging animations powered by Framer Motion, including 3D-tilting project cards, a custom mouse cursor, and subtle micro-interactions that enhance the user experience.

Dynamic Project Filtering: A clean and intuitive interface on the projects page that allows visitors to filter projects by category, with smooth, animated transitions.

Performance Optimized: Built for speed. Heavy components like the tsparticles background are lazy-loaded using next/dynamic, and all project images are optimized with the Next.js <Image> component to ensure fast load times.

Cyberpunk Aesthetic: A sophisticated dark theme with a vibrant cyan accent color, custom fonts, and glowing neon effects to create a unique and memorable visual identity.

Theming: Features a fully functional dark and light mode toggle, managed with next-themes.
