# ZPortfolio

A performance-focused developer portfolio built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Framer Motion.

**[Live Demo](https://your-live-demo-link.com)**

This repository contains the source code for a personal developer portfolio designed to showcase projects with a clean, cyberpunk-inspired aesthetic. The primary goals were to achieve a fast, responsive, and interactive user experience while maintaining a well-structured and scalable codebase.

-----

## Features

  * **Adaptive UI:** The layout is fully responsive, featuring an icon-only sidebar on mobile and tablet devices that expands on desktop for a seamless experience across all screen sizes.
  * **Fluid Animations & UX:** User interactions are enhanced with animations powered by **Framer Motion**. Key features include 3D-tilting project cards on hover, a custom mouse cursor, and subtle micro-interactions that guide the user.
  * **Dynamic Content Filtering:** The projects page includes an intuitive category-based filter with smooth, animated transitions between filter states.
  * **Optimized for Performance:** Core performance is prioritized through modern web development practices. Heavy components like the `tsParticles` background are lazy-loaded using `next/dynamic`, and all project images are optimized via the Next.js `<Image>` component to minimize load times.
  * **Themed UI:** A sophisticated dark theme is enabled by default with a vibrant cyan accent. The project also includes a functional light/dark mode toggle, managed with `next-themes`.
